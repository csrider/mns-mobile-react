# INCOMPLETE! - Ignore This Repo!

Go away, unless you're a hiring manager!  ;)

This is an early work-in-progress of my attempt to showcase my React work. If you came here as part of a hiring process, please refer instead to my "mns-mobile-refactor-react" repo (https://github.com/csrider/mns-mobile-refactor-react)... that is a more true-to-life representation of work I actually did (whereas this repo is more of the early beginnings of a fresh refactor).

# MNS Connections-Mobile React Demonstrator

A demonstrator of the MNS *Connections Mobile* UI, built on React. This is intended to demonstrate the next proposed version of the mobile UI/app (v3), using the latest modern frameworks.

### NOTE: This is not the complete version (it's the very first boilerplate draft I began with in the early stages of the prototype), as I am still trying to sanitize and get the much more complete early version authorized for public release.

## Public Notice: 2022-05-08

This project has been sanitized and adapted to work with a MySQL backend in order to demonstrate my work (also in the absence of a full MessageNet server software platform).

## To get started from scratch...
1. Clone this repo
2. Change dir to your local clone of the repo
3. Run: npm install
4. Run: npm start
